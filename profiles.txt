The girls...

Gem
The birthday girl her self! Very excited about the wine tour this year after recently acquiring a strong apprectiation if Pino t Noir and will be as partying as hard as anyone if not the hardest! Just don’t get in her way when shes eating cheese burgers or she’ll bite your face off.

Partying
Heating up frozen sausie rolls and party pies
Smashing shot glasses on bars
Weaknesses:
Randomly falling over
Smashing her iphone screen

Jess
If anyone will be able to keep up with Gemma’s pace this weekend it will be Jess. Ruthless and aggressive on the d floor and an epic party starter. Cooks mean as feeds and knows how to make amazing cocktails.
Strengths:
Cutting shapes
Cooking mass brekkies even when hungover
Dance offs
Weaknesses
Talks super fast when excited

Jelly shots and turtle juice
